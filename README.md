# Clinical-report-automatic-generation-system
## This project is an AI-assisted case screening system developed by Dr. Liuzhen Su's team at Fudan University.
Designed and optimized an end-to-end clinical report generation system using NLP and deep learning to convert raw
EHRs into concise, clinician-ready summaries, significantly improving report accuracy, consistency, and generation
efficiency
### Built a complete data pipeline for real-world hospital text, including cleaning, de-noising, terminology normalization,
class balancing and stringent quality-control checks; established robust training, validation, and evaluation procedures
Trained, tuned, and benchmarked Transformer / Seq2Seq models using ROUGE/BLEU and clinician-centric
consistency metrics; iteratively refined decoding strategies and post-processing to reduce hallucinations and ensure
faithful inclusion of key medical findings
### Collaborated closely with clinicians to define interpretability, factuality, and safety requirements, and implemented a
human-in-the-loop feedback loop to improve model reliability and clinical applicability
